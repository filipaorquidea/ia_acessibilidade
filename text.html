        Jacob is a paralegal in a law firm.
        <br>He reviews cases and writes summaries, cross-referencing them to clients.
        <br>He's building expertise in law and is hoping to go to law school in a year.
        <p>As far as Jacob is concerned, it's the tecnology that's handicapped, not him.
        <br>When everything is in place, he can work just as fast and just as effectively as anyone in his office.
        <p>He's a bit of a gadget geek, always trying out new tools.
        <br>The last few years have been a lot of fun with all the new apps, and VoiceOver on his Mac and phone lets him use most of them pretty well.
        <br>He likes the challenge of learning new tools.
        <p>His another challenge is running.
        <br> He's training for 10K run, running with a club in his neighborhood and using an app to plan his routes and track his distance.
        <p> He's just started to use the iPhone app, Passbook, and uses it to get train tickets and other travel.
        <br>The regional rail system has an app, so he can just pull up the barcode and scan it at the ticket office.
        <p> No fumbling for the right printed card - total independence. 
        <p>Same phone as everyone.
        <p>Same app as everyone, and it all just works.
